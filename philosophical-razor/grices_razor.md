# 格莱斯剃刀

作为一种简约原则，对于语言解释而言，会话含义优于语义语境。

`As a principle of parsimony, conversational implications are to be preferred over semantic context for linguistic explanations.`

`Grice's Razor is a principle of parsimony that states a preference for linguistic explanations in terms of conversational implicature, over explanations in terms of semantic context dependence. Here I propose a Gricean theory of knowledge attributions, and contend on the basis of Grice's Razor that it is superior to contextualism about “knows.”`
