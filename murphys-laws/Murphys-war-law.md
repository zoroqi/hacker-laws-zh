*   The easy way is always mined.
*   简单的总是被发现了的. (已经没有简单的了)

*   No combat ready unit has ever passed inspection.
*   No inspection ready unit has ever passed combat.

*   Napalm is an area support weapon.
*   Mines are equal opportunity weapons.
*   B\-52s are the ultimate close support weapon.
*   Sniper's motto: reach out and touch someone.
*   Killing for peace is like screwing for virginity.
*   The one item you need is always in short supply.

*   The enemy never watches until you make a mistake.
*   One enemy soldier is never enough, but two is entirely too many.
*   A clean (and dry) set of BDU's is a magnet for mud and rain.
*   The worse the weather, the more you are required to be out in it.

*   The perfect officer for the job will transfer in the day after that billet is filled by someone else.

*   Never tell the Platoon Sergeant you have nothing to do.
*   The seriousness of a wound (in a fire\-fight) is inversely proportional to the distance to any form of cover.
*   Walking point = sniper bait.
*   Your bivouac for the night is the spot where you got tired of marching that day.
*   If only one solution can be found for a field problem, then it is usually a stupid solution.
*   No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy.
*   The most dangerous thing in the combat zone is an officer with a map.
*   The problem with taking the easy way out is that the enemy has already mined it.
*   The buddy system is essential to your survival; it gives the enemy somebody else to shoot at.

*   The only time suppressive fire works is when it is used on abandoned positions.
*   There is nothing more satisfying that having someone take a shot at you, and miss.
*   Don't be conspicuous. In the combat zone, it draws fire. Out of the combat zone, it draws sergeants.

*   All or any of the above combined.
*   Avoid loud noises, there are few silent killers in a combat zone.

*   If you can see the flashes from the enemies' guns in battle, he can see yours too.
*   Flashlights, lighters and matches don't just illuminate the surrounding area; they illuminate you too.
*   Just because you have nearly impenetrable body armor and a hard\-ass Kevlar helmet, doesn't mean you don't have exposed areas.
*   There are few times when the enemy can't hear you: When he's dead, you're dead, or both.
    Addendum: When he's not there, when you're not there, or both.
*   Never cover a dead body with your own in hopes of looking like you're one of the casualties. Even using his cadaver is a stretch to avoid being shot "just in case."
*   You're only better than your enemy if you kill him first.

*   You think the enemy has better artillery support and the enemy thinks yours is better; you're both right.

*   Once you are in the fight it is way too late to wonder if this is a good idea.
*   NEVER get into a fight without more ammunition that the other guy.
*   Cover your Buddy, so he can be around to cover for you.
*   Decisions made by someone over your head will seldom be in your best interest.
*   Sometimes, being good and lucky still is not enough.
*   If the rear echelon troops are really happy, the front line troops probably do not have what they need.
*   If you are wearing body armor they will probably miss that part.
*   Happiness is a belt fed weapon.
*   Having all your body parts intact and functioning at the end of the day beats the alternative...
*   If you are allergic to lead it is best to avoid a war zone.
*   Hot garrison chow is better than hot C\-rations which, in turn, are better than cold C\-rations, which are better than no food at all. All of these, however, are preferable to cold rice balls even if they do have little pieces of fish in them.
*   A free fire zone has nothing to do with economics.
*   Medals are OK, but having your body and all your friends in one piece at the end of the day is better.
*   Being shot hurts.
*   Thousands of Veterans earned medals for bravery every day. A few were even awarded.
*   There is only one rule in war: When you win, you get to make up the rules.
*   C\-4 can make a dull day fun.
*   There is no such thing as a fair fight \-\- only ones where you win or lose.
*   If you win the battle you are entitled to the spoils. If you lose you don't care.
*   Nobody cares what you did yesterday or what you are going to do tomorrow. What is important is what you are doing \-\- NOW \-\- to solve our problem.
*   Always make sure someone has a can opener.
*   Prayer may not help . . . but it can't hurt.
*   Flying is better than walking. Walking is better than running. Running is better than crawling. All of these, however, are better than extraction by a Med\-Evac even if it is, technically, a form of flying.
*   If everyone does not come home none of the rest of us can ever fully come home either.
*   Carrying any weapon that you weren't issued (e.g, an AK) in combat is Not A Good Idea!
    A combat vet will know the sound of an unfamiliar weapon in an instant and will point and shoot.
    Not only that, AKs use green tracers which mean "shoot 'em all and let God sort them out".
    As has been noted, "Friendly fire isn't!"

#### Laws of War for Helicopters

*   Helicopter tail rotors are naturally drawn toward trees, stumps, rocks, etc.
    While it may be possible to ward off this event some of the time, it cannot, despite the best efforts of the crew, always be prevented.
    It's just what they do.
*   The engine RPM and the rotor RPM must BOTH be kept in the GREEN.
    Failure to heed this commandment can adversely affect the morale of the crew.
*   The terms Protective Armor and Helicopter are mutually exclusive.
*   "Chicken Plates" are not something you order in a restaurant.
*   The BSR (Bang Stare Red) Law:
    The louder the sudden bang in the helicopter, the quicker your eyes will be drawn to the gauges.
    Corollary: The longer you stare at the gauges the less time it takes them to move from green to red.
*   Loud, sudden noises in a helicopter WILL get your undivided attention.
*   The further you fly into the mountains, the louder the strange engine noises become.
*   It is a bad thing to run out of airspeed, altitude and ideas all at the same time.
*   "Pucker Factor" is the formal name of the equation that states the more hairy the situation is, the more of the seat cushion will be sucked up your butt.
    It can be expressed in its mathematical formula of:
     S (suction) + H (height above ground) + I (interest in staying alive) + T (# of tracers coming your way).
    Thus the term 'SHIT!' can also be used to denote a situation where a high Pucker Factor is being encountered.
*   Running out of pedal, fore or aft cyclic, or collective are all bad ideas.
    Any combination of these can be deadly.
    All the Laws of War for Helicopters were sent by [Jim Kirk](mailto:JimKirk2@aol.com) with courtesy of CWO4 Larry Gilbert (Ret). his brother\-in\-law that sent them to him
*   Helicopters have been described as nothing more than 50,000 parts flying in close formation. It is the mechanics responsibility to keep that formation as tight as possible.
*   It is mathematically impossible for either hummingbirds, or helicopters to fly. Fortunately, neither are aware of this.

#### Laws of War for Tanks

*   The same gun tube that would probably stay in alignment after lifting a car, will get you beaten after calibration if used to assist in climbing on the tank.
*   Tanks draw fire. A lot of it. It does not behoove the infantryman to hide behind one.
*   If you're close enough to actually hear an M1 series tank running, while in combat, and not part of the crew, you're too close.

#### Law of Fighting Airplanes

*   The enemy is always has the advantage.
*   Heat\-seeking missiles don't know the difference between friend and foe.
*   'Armor' is a fantasy invented by your C.O. to make you feel better.
*   Afterburners aren't.
*   Air Brakes don't.
*   Your cannon will jam in combat, and then when you get back to base there will be nothing wrong with it.
*   You may have the better plane, but the enemy is the better pilot. (or vise versa)
*   When getting spare parts for your aircraft, you can get them CHEAP \- FAST \- IN GOOD CONDITION,
    pick two. (This applies to everything)
*   Your radar will not pick up the enemy behind you or the one in the sun.
*   If you have got into the sun and are about to ambush the enemy, it will either be a trap or you'll run out of fuel.

*   Always remember: Shoot first and then swear up and down that you saw them pull out a grenade. This always works!!!
*   IED's will be placed frequently in the same spots over and over again.
*   Always shoot the guy walking down the MSR in the middle of the night carrying a gas can and a shovel. If they can't place the IED's, they can't blow you up!

    If, throughout your entire life you have been ruled by Murphy's Law, then at least one thing, usually no more than that, will go so right as to make up for a lifetime of failures.
